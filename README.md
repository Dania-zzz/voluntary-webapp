### Voluntary Web App
This project proposes the development of the server side of an online web application that offers a user-friendly interface, enabling individuals to discover volunteering opportunities that are tailored to their preferences while also providing organizations with the tools needed to connect with volunteers more effectively.

### Tech Stack
The server side of the web app was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
• PostgreSQL – A relational database that will store the application data.<br>
• Sequelize – An ORM for managing interactions with the PostgreSQL database, simplifying data handling.<br>
• Node.js – The backend framework that will handle server-side logic and manage API requests.<br>
• Express.js – a minimal and flexible framework built on Node.js, providing robust tools for building APIs.<br>
